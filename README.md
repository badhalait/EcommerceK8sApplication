Kubernetes E-Commerce Application Deployment
This project demonstrates the deployment of a simulated e-commerce application in a Kubernetes environment. The application is designed to ensure high availability, security, and scalability, and it includes multiple components such as a React frontend, Node.js backend services, MongoDB, and RabbitMQ.

Overview
The e-commerce application consists of multiple components deployed within a Kubernetes cluster:

Frontend: A React-based web application served by Nginx.
Backend API: Node.js microservices that handle various business operations.
Database: MongoDB cluster used for persistent data storage.
Message Queue: RabbitMQ for asynchronous order processing.
This deployment focuses on providing scalable, secure, and observable infrastructure using Kubernetes' native capabilities.

Architecture
The application consists of the following components:

Frontend (React + Nginx): Serves the user interface for the e-commerce store.
Backend (Node.js): Microservices handling APIs, user management, product inventory, orders, etc.
MongoDB: Stores product data, user information, and order details.
RabbitMQ: Used to handle asynchronous message processing, primarily for order management.
Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Kubernetes Cluster
kubectl
Helm (optional, for easier chart management)
A running Ingress Controller (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller)
Persistent Volume support in your cluster (for MongoDB and RabbitMQ)

Deployment Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kubernetes-ecommerce-app.git
cd kubernetes-ecommerce-app
2. Apply Kubernetes Manifests
Ensure your cluster is up and running. Then apply the manifests:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/mongodb-statefulset.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/rabbitmq-statefulset.yaml
3. Setup Ingress
Configure the ingress for exposing the frontend and backend services:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f manifests/ingress.yaml
4. Configure Secrets and ConfigMaps
Make sure to create the necessary ConfigMaps and Secrets for the application to run:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f config/configmap.yaml
kubectl apply -f config/secrets.yaml
5. Setup Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
Enable autoscaling for the frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f manifests/hpa.yaml
Networking and Ingress
We use an Ingress Controller to expose the frontend and backend services externally. The Ingress is configured with path-based routing to serve traffic appropriately.

Update the ingress.yaml file to reflect your domain configuration, then apply it to your cluster. Ensure your DNS points to the ingress controller IP.

Example:

yaml
Copy code
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ecommerce-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
    - host: ecommerce-app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend-service
                port:
                  number: 80
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: backend-service
                port:
                  number: 3000
Monitoring and Autoscaling
Monitoring: We use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualization. You can install them using Helm:

bash
Copy code
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
Logging: Use the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log management. Ensure all services output logs to standard output (stdout), which Kubernetes will capture.

Autoscaling: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is enabled based on CPU/memory usage. You can modify scaling thresholds in hpa.yaml based on your cluster's performance requirements.

Debugging & Troubleshooting
1. Frontend Inaccessible:
Check if Ingress is configured correctly and DNS is resolving.
Verify that the frontend service is running and reachable via kubectl get services.
2. Backend Connectivity Issues with MongoDB:
Verify network policies aren't blocking traffic.
Ensure the MongoDB StatefulSet pods are running and the service is reachable.
3. RabbitMQ Message Processing Delays:
Check RabbitMQ logs and metrics using kubectl logs <rabbitmq-pod-name>.
Verify RabbitMQ and backend configuration for concurrency and message acknowledgments.
4. Resource Issues:
Use Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU/memory usage.
Scale the application using HPA or manually adjusting replicas.
